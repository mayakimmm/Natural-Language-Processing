# Unit 6 - Natural Language Processing Project

## Introduction

Natural language processing (NLP) is used in many apps and devices to interact with users and make meaning of text to determine how to respond, find information, or to create new text. Your goal is to use natural language processing techniques to identify structure, patterns, and meaning in a text to have conversations with a user, execute commands, perform manipulations on the text, or generate new text.

## Requirements

Use your knowledge of object-oriented programming, ArrayLists, the String class, and algorithms to create a program that uses natural language processing techniques:

- **Create at least two ArrayLists** – Create at least two ArrayLists to store the data used in your program, such as data from text files or entered by the user.
- **Implement one or more algorithms** – Implement one or more algorithms that use loops and conditionals to find or manipulate elements in an ArrayList or String object.
- **Use methods in the String classs** - Use one or more methods in the String class in your program, such as to divide text into sentences or phrases.
- **Use at least one natural language processing technique** – Use a natural language processing technique to process, analyze, and/or generate text.
- **Document your code** – Use comments to explain the purpose of the methods and code segments and note any preconditions and postconditions.

## Project Description

Write a description of the goal and/or problem that your application. Include descriptions of what text is being analyzed, either if its text files you are using to interpret text an how the user interacts with your project.

The goal of our project was to show a sentence and determine how many nouns, verbs, and adjectives there are within that sentence. The text that is being analyzed is the sentence text files. The code allows the word to become its own array of words which makes it easier to check it. The code than counts how many times that word shows in the dictionary file which than adds the count to the system.out.println. The user than types in 1, to see if they want to pick a number 1-5. If they type in 1, they will have to choose a number 1-5 and once they do, they will see a sentence and how many parts of speech there are.
